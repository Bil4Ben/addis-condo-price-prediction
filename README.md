# Addis Ababa Condominium Resale Price Prediction

## Project Overview

The city administration of Addis Ababa has developed large-scale condominium housing projects to address residential shortages. These units are allocated primarily through a lottery system and financed through structured mortgage schemes such as 10/90, 20/80, and 40/60 arrangements.

Resale prices of these condominium units vary significantly depending on structural characteristics, legal conditions, location factors, and broader market dynamics.

This project aims to build a data mining and machine learning solution to predict the resale price of condominium units in Addis Ababa.

## Problem Statement

Condominium resale prices are influenced by:

- Unit size (m²)
- Number of bedrooms
- Floor level
- Building height
- Loan type (10/90, 20/80, 40/60)
- Loan repayment status
- Finishing quality
- Location within the city
- Proximity to roads, markets, hospitals, airports, and public transport
- Inflation and fuel price fluctuations

Due to the unstructured nature of available listing data (mixed languages, emojis, inconsistent formatting), a major part of this project focuses on data wrangling and feature extraction.
